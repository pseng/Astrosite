Setting up apiÂ´s or just custom coding elements in an LMS with HTML elements that add that extra personalization has always come with issues. If you are a learning designer you need to be a programmer as well, if there is a seperate person then you need to collaborate which may slow things down. The ability to add custom tables or layouts, or program a simple API call is now something you can do with AI.
