AI: Your Media Co-Pilot for Engaging eLearning

Imagine creating eLearning courses that truly captivate learners. AI can make this a reality by acting as your intelligent media assistant.  The core strength? AI can now read and understand your learning content with remarkable accuracy. By analyzing the text of your course, AI can suggest relevant media to boost engagement and comprehension.

Simply ask the AI, "What visuals would best illustrate this concept about photosynthesis?" and it can suggest icons, infographics, or even relevant video snippets. But it goes beyond simple suggestions. By incorporating principles like Mayer's multimedia principles, AI can advise on adhering to the Coherence Principle by suggesting only relevant and necessary images, avoiding extraneous visuals that might overload the learner. Or it might recommend using signaling to highlight important parts of an infographic, following the Signaling Principle.

If your content is geared towards skill acquisition, AI can use Merrill's First Principles of Instruction as a framework. For example, if you're teaching a procedure, it might recommend an animation demonstrating the task or an interactive simulation for the learner to practice.

Furthermore, by integrating additional learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, the AI can help you optimize the complexity of the media suggested, ensuring it aligns with the learner's processing capacity. It may suggest breaking down complex diagrams into smaller, manageable chunks or using interactive elements to control the pace of information delivery.

Essentially, AI transforms media selection from a time-consuming guess to a data-driven, learner-centric process, empowering educators to create truly impactful eLearning experiences. It is also easy to show the AI examples of how to format or structure the text so that the AI adheres to these rules when suggesting media.
