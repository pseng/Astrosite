Putting together Data from a Personal Learning Network

Instead of a walled garden, picture a vibrant ecosystem where learners are at the center of their own Personal Learning Networks (PLNs). This network encompasses a diverse array of learning resources, tools, communities, and experiences, both formal and informal.  The AI-powered architecture acts as the intelligent weaver, connecting these disparate threads into a cohesive and personalized learning tapestry.

1. Data Inflow: Beyond the Traditional Classroom

Our learner, Sarah, is still at the heart of the story. But now, her learning journey extends far beyond a single course or platform. Data flows into her central Learning Record Store (LRS) from a multitude of sources:

Formal Learning Platforms:  Traditional LMS platforms, online courses, and virtual classrooms contribute assessment results, activity logs, and progress data, and activity indexes.
Informal Learning Activities: Sarah might participate in online forums, watch educational YouTube videos, or attend webinars. Plugins and APIs can capture data from these interactions, tracking her engagement and learning.
Real-World Experiences:  Perhaps Sarah is involved in a project-based learning activity, an internship, or a volunteer experience. The system could incorporate reflections, artifacts, and performance reviews from these experiences to provide a more complete picture of her skills and knowledge.
Personal Learning Tools: Sarah might use apps for language learning, coding practice, or skill development. These tools can be integrated into the PLN, feeding data into her LRS.
Social Learning Interactions: Sarah's interactions within online communities, study groups, or mentorship programs can provide valuable insights into her learning process and collaboration skills. These interactions can be tracked using learner record stores.
2. The LRS: A Central Hub for a Decentralized Network

The Learner Record Store (LRS), built on open standards like Caliper, becomes the central hub that aggregates and standardizes data from all these diverse sources. It acts as a secure and portable record of Sarah's learning journey, capturing a much richer and more nuanced picture than a traditional transcript.

3. The AI Weaver: Making Connections and Personalizing the Experience

The AI still plays a crucial role, but now its task is even more sophisticated. It analyzes data from across Sarah's entire PLN, identifying connections and patterns that might be invisible to her or any individual instructor.

Cross-Platform Insights: The AI might notice that Sarah excels in hands-on projects within her informal learning activities but struggles with theoretical concepts in her formal coursework. This insight can trigger personalized recommendations that bridge the gap.
Skill Mapping Across Contexts: The AI can map Sarah's skills and competencies across different contexts, recognizing that a skill demonstrated in a volunteer project is just as relevant as one demonstrated in a classroom setting.
Dynamic Network Recommendations:  The AI can suggest new resources, communities, or mentors to add to Sarah's PLN, based on her evolving interests and learning goals. It might connect her with online communities, suggest relevant articles or videos, or even identify potential mentors.
4. Learner Agency and Control:

Crucially, Sarah remains in control of her PLN and her data. She decides which sources to connect, what data to share, and how her information is used. This empowers her to actively shape her own learning journey and build a network that truly supports her individual needs.

The Power of an Open Ecosystem

This PLN-centric approach, powered by an AI-infused architecture, offers several advantages:

Holistic View of the Learner: It paints a much more complete picture of the learner, capturing their diverse skills, interests, and experiences.
Lifelong Learning Support: It extends the learning experience beyond the confines of formal education, supporting continuous growth and development.
Increased Learner Agency: It empowers learners to take ownership of their learning journeys and build networks that support their individual goals.
Greater Flexibility and Adaptability:  It allows the learning experience to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the learner and the evolving landscape of knowledge and skills.
By embracing the concept of a Personal Learning Network and leveraging the power of open standards and AI, we can create a truly learner-centered ecosystem that unlocks the 2 Sigma potential for everyone, fostering a future of lifelong learning and personal growth.
