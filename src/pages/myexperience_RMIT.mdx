## Introduction ##
Building on the foundation of my passion for impactful learning, my experience spans over 15 years dedicated to driving organizational capability through digital transformation and learning technology. I've had the privilege of applying my expertise across diverse sectors, including corporate, research, and education, collaborating with globally recognized organizations like UNESCO, Nokia, and RMIT. This breadth of experience has allowed me to hone my skills in developing and implementing strategic learning frameworks tailored to specific organizational needs.  I'm particularly adept at designing engaging blended learning solutions that effectively combine different learning modalities.  Furthermore, I'm deeply involved in the evolving field of AI in learning, not just understanding its potential but actively shaping its application, including providing consultancy services on how to best integrate AI into learning design. These pages will go deeper into the specifics of how I've leveraged these skills to help organizations achieve their learning and development goals, and you'll find detailed examples of impactful projects and initiatives throughout my CV.

### AI Working group ###


the AI working group was set up to respond to the growing influence of AI, as such the group collaborated to develop some do's and don'ts as well as guiding questions to help teachers. There was also guidance on prompt engineering and with work starting on developing a prompt library



### Information value chain and architecture ###

I worked towards a more unified approach to data, this was partly through moving from Excel to PowerApps. This was supported by bringing data in from the LMS through REST API calls as well. Aside from this there was also work on tagging to take files out of folder hierarchies and improve information architecture 
Professional development courses

I created and implemented a number of courses for teacher professional development, the courses were developed to provide engaging learning and move away from the information heavy and text heavy paradigm. Another addition was game based learning elements. They supported objectives that needed quick decisions, and by using the game elements of timers and lives, the activity emulated the outside situation more closely. Text boxes that encouraged reflective consideration that would be a later reference point were added to courses.
One of the areas that was recognised is my work with AI and data, I worked on areas that would allow AI to become a tool in creating truly adaptive learning. This is in contrast to the ideas of personalised learning, which might be a learning path that is set based on your needs. Adaptive learning changes your learning path as you move through the learning, by using predictive analysis technologies, intelligent recommendation systems and more. Much of this can be found in My Thinking section is you look at the AI infused learning architecture there.
