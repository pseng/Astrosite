## CNA in Ethiopia

The CNA tools were used to collect data on the large scale programme Africa RISING, a set of projects to address sustainable intensification of agricultural systems.  I was part of the data collection from the CNA in Ethiopia which included a graph analysis of communication relationships between project members. The aim was to identify graph elements such as bridges which often indicated that there was a single connection between 2 clusters of the project which could pose a risk if the connection broke.

## CNA in Pakistan with the UNDP

The CNA tools were used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the data collection and reporting mechanisms, and to determine how well these mechanisms align with the reporting needs of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The CNA also looked at how data is currently being used for reporting and decision-making.

## Sindh District training SAGP-L

My work here was to support the effective delivery of training from a syllabus developed based on the training materials used during the inception workshop. This syllabus was available in printed form and as part of a larger consolidated manual to ensure easy access. Curated open educational resources were incorporated for areas of communication. Additionally, a variety of tools related to effective communication were made available to participants. The training materials were facilitated and accompanied by self-directed learning resources,which allowed participants to engage both digital and offline learning.
