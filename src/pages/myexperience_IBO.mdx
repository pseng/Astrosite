## Nano pds

The nano-pds were a set of internal and public micro-learning courses for teacher professional development. They were linked to specific topics and aimed to be a just in time resource to introduce topics for emerging curriculum changes. The choice of Evolve was based on the need for mobile first delivery to support the just in time, informal learning nature as well as the ability to create text inputs that could be saved as PDFs to help as performance supports.

As well as the external facing nanos I also developed the internal examiner support course based on the 4C-ID framework where the sequence followed a strategy of experiential learning of grading with gradually decreasing scaffolding.

## Development of integrated curriculum

I worked on improving the connection between the face to face offering of professional development and the online. My work went to addressing differences between the self access online and the facilitated face to face. Part of the solution was to use a more task and problem based approach. The task or problem would be more consistent between the two delivery methods and the resources would be flexible, the main difference would be creating support for the face to face and the online. This would at least partially help to connect the course when delivered through either online or face to face.
